# Foundational Principles for Policies

**Purpose**: Policies establishes the fundamental rules that govern the creation, amendment, and enforcement of all actions within the status-go project. These policies reflect our core 
values of inclusivity, transparency, and consensus-driven decision-making while defining enforceable rules that guide status-go contributions. Policies are not merely guidelines but are to be 
respected and adhered to, ensuring alignment across the community.

## 1. Inclusivity

Every member of the status-go community must have an equal opportunity to participate in the creation and review of policies. Contributions from all backgrounds and perspectives are encouraged and 
respected. The process must ensure that:

- **Open participation**: Any individual or group who interacts with or contributes to the project has the right to voice their opinions and suggestions.
- **Accessibility**: Policies must be written in clear, accessible language, and the decision-making process should be easy to understand for everyone involved.

## 2. Transparency

All discussions, decisions, and processes related to policy creation must be fully transparent. This includes:

- **Open documentation**: Discussions leading to policy decisions must be documented and made publicly available. This ensures that anyone can review the rationale behind a decision.
- **Clear communication**: Changes to policies, including their rationale, must be clearly communicated to the community through appropriate channels.

## 3. Consensus

Policies must be created and modified through a consensus-based approach, ensuring that the community agrees on how to move forward. The following principles guide consensus building:

- **Collaborative discussion**: Proposals must be discussed openly, with all points of view considered.
- **Dispute resolution**: If disagreements arise, efforts must be made to find a compromise that balances the needs of all stakeholders.
- **Final agreement**: Policies should be approved by a clear consensus, meaning that while not everyone may agree 100%, all should feel their voices were heard and respected, and the final decision 
reflects the community’s general will.

## 4. Enforceability and Respect for Policies

- **Key stakeholder approval**: The guild does not have unilateral enforcement power. Instead, policies require explicit recorded approval from all key stakeholders before becoming enforceable. This 
includes team leads, the status-go Guild, and other relevant parties.
- **Respect and adherence**: Policies are not optional guidelines. Once approved, they are enforceable rules that all contributors to the status-go project are expected to respect. This ensures 
consistency, fairness, and alignment with the community's shared goals.

By adhering to these foundational principles, status-go policies create a framework that balances inclusivity, transparency, and consensus with the need for enforceable and respected policies.
