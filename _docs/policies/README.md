# Foundational Principles for Policies

**Purpose**: Policies establishes the fundamental rules that govern
the creation, amendment, and enforcement of all actions within the
`status-go` repository. These policies reflect our core values of
inclusivity, transparency, and consensus-driven decision-making while
defining enforceable rules that guide `status-go` contributions. Policies
are not merely guidelines but are to be respected and adhered to, ensuring
alignment across contributors.

## Upholding Policies Through Consensus

### Collective Agreement

The enforceability of policies stems not from the authority of any
single individual or group but from the collective agreement and shared
commitment of all `status-go` contributors. Policies are not imposed
unilaterally but are the result of transparent discussions and explicit
recorded approval from key stakeholders. This includes team leads,
members of the @status-im/status-go-guild GitHub team, and other
relevant contributors.

### Shared Responsibility

Respecting and adhering to policies is a shared responsibility
that reflects the values and goals of `status-go` contributors. Approved
policies are not merely recommendations but agreed-upon standards,
created through mutual understanding and collaboration, that guide
how we work together and contribute to the project.

### Mutual Enforcement through Alignment

The power of enforcement does not rest with any one authority; it
arises from the collective commitment of all contributors to uphold
policies that have been collaboratively crafted and agreed upon. This
ensures that policies are respected not out of obligation but because
they represent the shared vision and trust of the contributors.

### Fostering Alignment

Policies are designed to ensure consistency, fairness, and alignment
across the teams, creating a framework that supports effective
collaboration and decision-making. By honouring the principles of
inclusivity and consensus, we strengthen trust and accountability
within all contributors.

By grounding our policies in transparency, mutual respect, and collective
ownership, the `status-go` project ensures they are both enforceable and
reflective of the shared goals of all contributors.

## Inclusivity

Every `status-go` contributor must have an equal opportunity to
participate in the creation and review of policies. Contributions
from all backgrounds and perspectives are encouraged and respected.
The process must ensure:

- **Open participation**: Any individual or group who interacts
with or contributes to the project has the right to voice their
opinions and suggestions.
- **Accessibility**: Policies must be written in clear, accessible
language, and the decision-making process should be easy to understand
for everyone involved.

## Transparency

All discussions, decisions, and processes related to policy creation
must be fully transparent. This includes:

- **Open documentation**: Discussions leading to policy decisions
must be documented and made publicly available. This ensures that
anyone can review the rationale behind a decision.
- **Clear communication**: Changes to policies, including their
rationale, must be clearly communicated to the contributors through
appropriate channels.

## Consensus

Policies must be created and modified through a consensus-based approach,
ensuring that contributors agree on how to move forward. The following
principles should guide consensus building:

- **Collaborative discussion**: Proposals must be discussed openly,
with all points of view considered.
- **Dispute resolution**: If disagreements arise, efforts must be
made to find a compromise that balances the needs of all stakeholders.
- **Final agreement**: Policies should be approved by a clear consensus,
meaning that while not everyone may agree 100%, all should feel their
voices were heard and respected, and the final decision reflects
contributorsâ€™ general will.
